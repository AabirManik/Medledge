# 🛡️ Secure Report Sharing Platform with Audit Trail

A **Solidity smart contract** built to securely **upload, share, and track reports** on the blockchain.  
It ensures **transparency, immutability, and trust** by maintaining an on-chain **audit trail** of all report uploads.

## 📘 Project Description

The **Secure Report Sharing Platform** is a simple decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to upload reports to the blockchain.  
Each report is stored with details such as:
- Title  
- Description  
- IPFS hash (file reference)  
- Uploader’s address  
- Timestamp  

By using blockchain, the project ensures:
- Reports can’t be modified or deleted once uploaded.  
- Every upload is recorded as an event (audit trail).  
- The system remains transparent and verifiable by anyone.

This project is perfect for **beginners** learning:
- Solidity smart contract development  
- How to log immutable data using blockchain events  
- How IPFS and blockchain can work together

## ⚙️ What It Does

- 📝 **Upload Reports:** Users can upload report metadata (title, description, IPFS link).  
- 🔍 **Retrieve Reports:** Anyone can view all uploaded reports or get a specific one by ID.  
- 🧾 **Audit Trail:** Each upload emits an event recorded on the blockchain, ensuring full transparency.  
- 💡 **Off-chain Storage Integration:** The IPFS hash allows large files to be stored off-chain securely.
